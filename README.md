# Roly-Portfoley

## Description
This is the first iteration of my portfolio page. It demonstrates the use of more advanced css techniques like flexbox, pseudo elements, and media queries for a mobile-friendly viewing experience. This project provided me with experience using the aforementioned css techniques.  It also laid a foundation for future additions, to show the evolution of my education in programming languages and techniques.
